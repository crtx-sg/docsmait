# Project Resources Operations Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Backend API Issues**

#### Problem 1: Missing Current User ID in Project Details
**Issue**: The frontend couldn't determine if the current user has permission to edit/delete resources because `current_user_id` was not included in the project details response.

**Fix** (`backend/app/projects_service_pg.py`):
```python
return {
    # ... existing fields ...
    "current_user_id": user_id,
    "is_creator": project.created_by == user_id
}
```

#### Problem 2: Missing uploaded_by_username in Resources
**Issue**: Resources didn't include the uploader's username, making it hard for users to understand who created each resource.

**Fix** (`backend/app/projects_service_pg.py`):
```python
for resource in project.resources:
    # Get uploader username
    uploader = db.query(User).filter(User.id == resource.uploaded_by).first()
    uploaded_by_username = uploader.username if uploader else "Unknown"
    
    resources.append({
        # ... existing fields ...
        "uploaded_by_username": uploaded_by_username,
        "updated_at": resource.updated_at.isoformat() if hasattr(resource, 'updated_at') and resource.updated_at else None
    })
```

### 2. **Frontend Permission Issues**

#### Problem 3: Incorrect Permission Checks
**Issue**: The permission checks in the frontend were using `project_details.get("current_user_id")` which was not available, causing all permission checks to fail.

**Fix** (`frontend/pages/_Projects.py`):
```python
# Before (incorrect):
if project_details.get("is_creator", False) or resource["uploaded_by"] == project_details.get("current_user_id"):

# After (correct):
can_edit = (project_details.get("is_creator", False) or 
           resource["uploaded_by"] == project_details.get("current_user_id"))

if can_edit:
    # Perform operation
```

#### Problem 4: Incomplete Content Updates  
**Issue**: The `update_project_resource` function only included content in the payload if it was truthy, which meant empty content couldn't be saved.

**Fix** (`frontend/pages/_Projects.py`):
```python
# Before:
payload = {
    "name": name,
    "resource_type": resource_type
}
if content:
    payload["content"] = content

# After:
payload = {
    "name": name,
    "resource_type": resource_type,
    "content": content if content is not None else ""
}
```

### 3. **Database Schema Enhancement**

#### Problem 5: Missing updated_at Field
**Issue**: Project resources didn't have an `updated_at` timestamp field to track when they were last modified.

**Fix** (`backend/app/db_models.py`):
```python
class ProjectResource(Base):
    # ... existing fields ...
    updated_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now(), onupdate=func.now())
```

**Migration Script**: `backend/migrations/add_updated_at_to_project_resources.py`
- Adds `updated_at` column to existing table
- Updates existing records with `uploaded_at` values
- Includes rollback functionality

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling and User Feedback**

#### Problem 6: Poor Error Messages and User Feedback
**Issue**: Users didn't get clear feedback about why operations failed or what permissions they had.

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Better Permission Error Messages**:
```python
if can_edit:
    # Perform operation
else:
    st.error("❌ You can only edit resources you created or if you're the project creator")
```

2. **Loading Indicators**:
```python
with st.spinner("Updating resource..."):
    success, result = update_project_resource(...)
```

3. **Debug Information** (temporarily added):
```python
st.write(f"🔍 Debug - Can edit: {can_edit}")
st.write(f"🔍 Debug - Is creator: {project_details.get('is_creator', False)}")
st.write(f"🔍 Debug - Resource uploaded_by: {resource.get('uploaded_by')}")
st.write(f"🔍 Debug - Current user ID: {project_details.get('current_user_id')}")
```

4. **Consistent Success Messages**:
```python
st.success("✅ Glossary resource updated successfully!")
st.success("✅ Resource deleted!")
```

### 5. **Operation Flow Improvements**

#### Fixed Operations for All Resource Types:

**Save Operations**:
1. Validate required fields (name)
2. Check edit permissions
3. Call update API with all fields
4. Clear session state on success
5. Refresh page with `st.rerun()`

**Delete Operations**:
1. Check delete permissions
2. Call delete API
3. Clear session state on success  
4. Refresh page with `st.rerun()`

**Cancel Operations**:
1. Clear all session state variables
2. Refresh page with `st.rerun()`

### 6. **Session State Management Fixes**

#### Problem 7: Session State Conflicts
**Issue**: Session state variables could persist between different resource types causing conflicts.

**Fix** (`frontend/pages/_Projects.py`):
```python
# Enhanced cleanup at page end
cleanup_states = [
    'selected_glossary_id', 'selected_glossary_data',
    'selected_reference_id', 'selected_reference_data', 
    'selected_book_id', 'selected_book_data'
]
for state in cleanup_states:
    if hasattr(st.session_state, state):
        del st.session_state[state]
```

### 7. **Permission Matrix Implementation**

| User Type | View | Edit Own | Delete Own | Edit Others | Delete Others |
|-----------|------|----------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Project Creator | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Resource Uploader | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Project Member | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Implementation**:
```python
# Frontend permission check
can_edit = (project_details.get("is_creator", False) or 
           resource["uploaded_by"] == project_details.get("current_user_id"))

# Backend permission check  
if project.created_by != user_id and resource.uploaded_by != user_id:
    return {"success": False, "error": "Only project creator or resource uploader can update this resource"}
```

## Files Modified

2. `backend/app/main.py` - Added PUT endpoint for resource updates  
3. `backend/app/db_models.py` - Added updated_at field to ProjectResource
4. `backend/migrations/add_updated_at_to_project_resources.py` - Database migration

### Frontend Files:
1. `frontend/pages/_Projects.py` - Fixed all resource operations and permission checks

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required:
- [x] Create resources of each type (glossary, reference, book)
- [ ] Select rows in each resource type table
- [ ] Edit resource names and content  
- [ ] Save changes and verify updates
- [ ] Test delete functionality
- [ ] Test cancel operations
- [ ] Verify permission restrictions work correctly
- [ ] Test with multiple users and different roles
- [ ] Verify session state is properly managed
- [ ] Test error handling for API failures
- [ ] Verify debug information shows correct values

### Edge Cases to Test:
- [ ] Empty content handling
- [ ] Large content (>1000 characters)  
- [ ] Special characters in names
- [ ] Network timeouts during operations
- [ ] Concurrent editing by multiple users
- [ ] Session state conflicts between resource types

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Run Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python migrations/add_updated_at_to_project_resources.py
   ```

2. **Deploy Backend Changes**: 
   - Updated projects service with enhanced data
   - New PUT endpoint for resource updates
   - Enhanced permission checking

3. **Deploy Frontend Changes**:
   - Updated Projects page with fixed operations
   - Enhanced error handling and user feedback

4. **Remove Debug Information**: 
   Once testing is complete, remove the debug output lines from the Save operations

5. **Verify Operations**:
   - Test all three resource types (Glossary, References, Books)  
   - Verify permissions work for different user roles
   - Confirm data persistence after operations

## Summary

All major issues with Save, Delete, and Cancel operations have been identified and fixed:

✅ **Backend API** - Added missing user ID and resource metadata  
✅ **Permission Checks** - Implemented proper frontend and backend validation  
✅ **Data Updates** - Fixed content handling and API payload structure  
✅ **User Experience** - Added loading indicators, error messages, and success feedback  
✅ **Session Management** - Enhanced state cleanup and conflict prevention  
✅ **Database Schema** - Added updated_at tracking for resources

The interactive dataframe tables for project resources should now work correctly with full CRUD operations and proper permission enforcement.
